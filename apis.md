description: Bontq is for any business that needs a bug tracking and project management
  application but does not have the internal resources, or budget, for a full-blown
  application suite.For many companies, the necessity to track bugs is often superseded
  by a lack of resources or by budgetary reasons. One option for companies in that
  situation could be to use an online service for tracking bugs. One online service
  stands out with a few extra features that make it quite useful for those tracking
  the bugs and those reporting the bugs.Bontq is an online solution that does both
  bug tracking as well as project management. But Bontq doesn???t stop there. This
  online solution also offers a client application that helps users easily snap and
  submit screenshots to aid in the bug tracking process.
